//Feladat:
//Requirement: Imagine a banking application. Create an Asp.Net Core Web Application that serves bank account details based on the request path.

//Consider the following hard-coded bank account details:

//accountNumber = 1001, accountHolderName = "Example Name", currentBalance = 5000

//You can store these details as an anonymous object. Eg: new { property1 = value, property2 = value }

//Example #1:

//If you receive a HTTP GET request at path "/" (default route), it has to return welcome message with status code HTTP 200.

//Request Url: /

//Request Method: GET

//Response Status Code: 200

//Response body(output):

//Welcome to the Best Bank

//Example #2:

//If you receive a HTTP GET request at path "/account-details", it has to return all the details of bank account as Json format as response with status code HTTP 200.

//Request Url: / account - details

//Request Method: GET

//Response Status Code: 200

//Response body(output):

// {
//    "accountNumber": 1001,
//    "accountHolderName": "Example Name",
//    "currentBalance": 5000
// }

//Example #3:

//If you receive a HTTP GET request at path "/account-statement", it has to return a dummy PDF file (assumed as bank statement) as response with status code HTTP 200.

//Request Url: / account - statement

//Request Method: GET

//Response Status Code: 200

//Response body(output):

//[some dummy PDF file]


//Example #4:

//If you receive a HTTP GET request at path "/get-current-balance/{accountNumber}", it has to return the corresponding current balance value as response with status code HTTP 200.

//The "accountNumber" should be an int value and should be equal to "1001".

//Request Url: / get - current - balance / 1001

//Request Method: GET

//Response Status Code: 200

//Response body(output):

//5000



//Example #6:

//If you receive a HTTP GET request at path "/get-current-balance/{accountNumber}", if the "accountNumber" is not equal to '1001', it should return HTTP 400 response.

//Request Url: / get - current - balance / 10

//Request Method: GET

//Response Status Code: 400

//Response body(output):

//Account Number should be 1001
